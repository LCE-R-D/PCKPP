PCK++
-----

A C++ Rewrite of PCK Studio, a tool to edit Minecraft Legacy Console Edition file formats! Not affiliated with Mojang Studios, 4J Studios, nor Microsoft. This is a non profit open source tool to improve on the existing [PCK Studio](https://github.com/PhoenixARC/-PCK-Studio).

Feel free to contribute (:

Special thanks to everyone who has contributed to PCK Studio over the years; especially my friends PhoenixARC, NessieHax/Miku666/nullptr, and EternalModz. Without you, this wouldn't be possible <3
